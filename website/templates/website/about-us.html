                        <p class="pb-20">Founded in 2013, Arogyam Ayush powered by golden green agriculture pvt ltd now with its 9+ years of experience
                            and expertise in the field of Agriculture , Ayurveda and Natural Healing, have inspired and
                            encouraged many of the renowned Ayurveda practioners to enter and enterprise in this field.
                            https://arogyamayush.com/ is managed by golden green agriculture pvt ltd.</p>

                        <p class="pb-20">Arogyam Ayush as the name implies, believes in providing a long and healthy life to everyone,
                            irrespective of their caste, creed and economic status. During these 3 decades of experience
                            and expertise of our pioneers, we are now committed to take this noble endeavour to newer
                            heights. We thus seek to ensure that this age old heritage does not succumb to modern
                            practices and medicines which claim to provide "hypothetical instant relief" from underlying
                            physiological and psychological ailments.</p>

                        <p class="pb-20"> We thus endeavour to spread and present this subject of Ayurveda and its various forms not
                            just in this region but worldwide through our network of wellness centres and practioners.
                            It is this endeavour which led us to the idea of making Ayurveda accessible to all through
                            digital platform. Through our online store (www.arogyamayush.com), Arogyam Ayush hopes to
                            make genuine and traditional ayurvedic products and health care services accessible to the
                            global consumers. This Online Ayurvedic Store proudly hosts and ships products of various
                            renowned brands Ayurvedic Brand Products & Medicines at Lowest Shipping Prices across India.

                        <p class="pb-20">This online store also provides free online consultation by its panel of well qualified,
                            trained and specialised ayurvedic doctors and physicians. Through this offering of free
                            online ayurvedic consultation, we hope to spread the goodness of ayurveda to every
                            household.</p>
